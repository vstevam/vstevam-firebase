# Vinicius Stevam website
Basic personal website to play around technologies and express my work and life.

## Tech Stack
- <b>Firebase:</b> is hosting the static files and using fuctions we can also server our node app
- <b>ExpressJS:</b> a web framework for node.js. I was between express and fastify but I'm current using fastify in another project so let's use express.
- <b>Harp/EJS:</b> Harp is a static web server that also serves Jade, Markdown, EJS, Less, Stylus, Sass, and CoffeeScript as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any configuration. In the next version I'm looking refactor to React or VueJs.

## To do List
